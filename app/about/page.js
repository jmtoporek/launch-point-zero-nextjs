        <h1>About Launch Point Zero</h1>
        <p>I've been trying to launch Keenforms.com for quite some time. After spending a lot of time building the app I decided to take everyone's advice about startups and put all my effort into marketing and promotion. I think the final straw was Amy Hoy saying on her excellent site Stacking the Bricks that <a href="https://stackingthebricks.com/5-things-i-wish-id-known-before-founding-saas/#marketing-10-product" target="_blank">SaaS success is 90% marketing 10% product.</a> I've been working on the code for Keenforms since 2017, I'm pretty sure it's been 99.5% produce, 0.5% marketing.</p>

        <p>Along the way I found a bunch of webpages with lists of places to launch or announce a startup. There are obvious choices like Product Hunt, Hacker News, and Betalist, but those sites can be very competitive, and it's easy to get lost in the shuffle. Keenforms was rejected by Betalist in 2020 for reasons that were never made clear. So I found a few sources online where all these sites where you can launch your startup and figured I'd keep notes of each one.</p>

        <p>However once I started going through each of these sites were out of date or inappropriate for launching. I found domains for sale, sites that had not posted anything new in months or years, sites that charged a lot of money to "share" your startup but had no way to prove they had the kind of web traffic to justify the price.</p>

        <p>Even the subreddits listed had problems - many of the subreddits mentioned prohibited self promotion, which meant they were useless for launching a subreddit. More than a few of them were abandoned or overrun by spammers. At least one subreddit had been banned.</p>

        <p>And so the idea for launch point zero was born - I checked out each site that I scraped and made notes about trying to launch on each one. I figured if I had this problem someone else would be interested in this information.</p>
